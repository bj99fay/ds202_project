Analysis: Average liveness is skewed to the right. Average loudness is skewed to the left. Averag energy alsp seems to slightly skewed to the left. The others seem to be normally distributed if the outliers are removed. 


```{R}
##Average Liveness

musicdata %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  geom_boxplot(aes(Fan_Genre, average_liveness), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  
  labs(y = "Average Liveness", x = "Music Genre", 
       
       title = "Average Liveness per music genre")+ ylim(0, 1)
```

Analysis: Average loudness of Rap genre is the highest. Soul genre has lowest average loudness. 

```{R}
##Average Tempo

musicdata %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  geom_boxplot(aes(Fan_Genre, average_tempo), fill = "yellow", alpha = 0.7) +
  
  labs(y = "Average Tempo", x = "Music Genre", 
       
       title = "Average Tempoe per music genre")+ ylim(65, 175)

#Analysis: Average tempo of Metal Genre is the highest with no outliers. Rap & Jazz genres have lower average tempos. The pthergenres are between 100 and 130. The Prog genre has many outliers on either side. 
```

```{R}
##Average Danceability

musicdata %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  geom_boxplot(aes(Fan_Genre, average_danceability), fill = "purple", alpha = 0.7) +
  
  labs(y = "Average Danceability", x = "Music Genre", 
       
       title = "Average Danceability per music genre")+ ylim(0, 1)

#Analysis: Rap & Pop genres have more danceability compared to other genres. While Grunge has lower danceability, it also have many outliers on the upper side. Metal & Prog have almost similar danceability but Prog genre has higher median value. 
```
```{R}
##Average Valence

musicdata %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  geom_boxplot(aes(Fan_Genre, average_valence), fill = "orange", alpha = 0.7) +
  
  labs(y = "Average Valence", x = "Music Genre", 
       
       title = "Average Valence per music genre")+ ylim(0, 1)

#Analysis: The average valence of Soul genre is  the highest with few outliers on the lower side. Average valence of Pop & Rap genres are almost the same with Pop genre having more variability. The other genres seem to have more or less similar average valence. 
```

```{R}
##Correlation between important variables
cor.music <- cor(musicdata[,c('average_liveness','average_loudness','average_tempo','average_instrumentalness','average_energy','average_danceability','average_acousticness','average_valence')])
ggcorrplot(cor.music,hc.order = TRUE,lab=TRUE) + ggtitle("Correlation between important predictors")

#Analysis: As can be seen from the correlation matrix, the correlation between average loudness and average energy is very high followed by the correlation between average valence and average danceability. Average energy & average acouticness have a high negative correlation followed by average loudness and average acousticness as would be expected.
